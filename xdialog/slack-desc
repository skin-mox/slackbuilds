# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

xdialog: xdialog (Dialog X Replacement)
xdialog:
xdialog: xdialog is designed to be a drop in replacement for the cdialog
xdialog: program. It converts any terminal based program  into a program
xdialog: with an X-windows  interface. The dialogs are easier to see and
xdialog: use  and the treeview adds an extra dimension to the  way menus
xdialog: can be displayed.
