# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

perl-anyevent:
perl-anyevent: AnyEvent provides a uniform interface to various event loops. This
perl-anyevent: allows module authors to use event loop functionality without
perl-anyevent: forcing module users to use a specific event loop implementation
perl-anyevent: (since more than one event loop cannot coexist peacefully).
